Scenario ecdh
Scenario eddsa
Scenario ethereum
Scenario bitcoin
Scenario reflow

Given my name is in a 'string' named 'identity'
and I have a 'string array' named '@context'
and I have a 'string dictionary' named 'proof'

When I create the ecdh key
and I create the eddsa key
and I create the ethereum key
and I create the reflow key
and I create the bitcoin key


When I create the ecdh public key
and I create the eddsa public key
and I create the ethereum address
and I create the bitcoin public key
and I create the reflow public key

Then I print the 'eddsa public key' as 'base58'
and I print the 'ethereum address'
and I print the 'ecdh public key' as 'base58'
and I print the 'bitcoin public key' as 'base58'
and I print the 'reflow public key' as 'base58'
and I print my name in 'identity'
and print my 'keyring'
and print the '@context'
and print the 'proof'
